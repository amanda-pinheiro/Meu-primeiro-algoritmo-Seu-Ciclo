My First Algorithm: 'Seu Ciclo' (Your Cycle)

An algorithm designed to assist individuals who menstruate in determining their menstrual cycle phases. 

Here, you are going to find the algorithm as the main file, but I also added the modules that I've created to achieve the project's purpose.
The three current modules used were:

1 - Interface: organizes the code into a pattern.

2 - Data: captures the main data for the program's outcome.

3 - Responses: pattern texts for each condition filtered by the main data.
